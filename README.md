# Books_Recommendation_System
A books recommandation system  make by using data science  methodology and flask to create and display website. 
Firstly download all the 3 dataset from kaggle website (books, user, ratings) then apply some methodologies of data science to clean and preprocessed the dataset and make 1 data set named popular dateset.

# Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommender System:
Dataset Acquisition:

Obtain three datasets from Kaggle, including information about books, users, and ratings.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Employ data science methodologies to clean and preprocess the datasets. Handle missing values, remove irrelevant information, and ensure consistency across the datasets.
Popular Dataset Creation:

Merge the cleaned datasets to form a unified dataset, referred to as the "popular dataset." This dataset focuses on books that have received a substantial number of ratings, ensuring a robust foundation for collaborative filtering.
User-Item Collaborative Filtering:

Create a user-item matrix based on user ratings for books. This matrix represents user preferences and serves as the basis for collaborative filtering.
Similarity Calculation:

Utilize cosine similarity or other similarity metrics to compute the relationships between users or items in the user-item matrix. This step helps identify patterns and similarities in user preferences.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:

Develop a mechanism to generate book recommendations based on the similarity between items. This allows the system to suggest books similar to those that a user has shown interest in.
Flask Web Application:

Utilize Flask to build a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for the recommendation system. Create routes to handle user input, such as the selection of a book, and to display personalized recommendations.
HTML Templates:

Design HTML templates for the web application, including input forms and recommendation display pages. These templates enhance the user experience by presenting information in a clear and organized manner.
In summary, collaborative filtering involves leveraging user preferences to recommend items. The collaborative filtering-based recommender system uses the popular dataset and applies similarity calculations to generate personalized book recommendations. The Flask web application facilitates user interaction, allowing individuals to input their preferences and receive tailored book suggestions.
